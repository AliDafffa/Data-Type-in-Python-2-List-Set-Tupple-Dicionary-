# Data-Type-in-Python-2-List-Set-Tupple-Dictionary-
## Use Case Summary

### Data Type

### Objective Statement

•	Get to know the type of data in Python.

•	Get to know the function of List, Set, Tupple and Dictionary.

•	Get to know how to convert data type in Python.

### Challenge

Requires accuracy to input data.

### Expected Outcome
•	Know the data type in Python.

•	Know the function of List, Set, Tupple and Dictionary.

•	Know how to convert data type in Python

## Data Type in Python

### List

List is a data structure in python that can store more than one data, such as an array.

### Tupple

Tupple are lists. The main difference between tupples and lists is that tuples are immutable

### Set 

Sets are used to store multiple items in a single variable, written in curly braces '{}'. A set is a collection that is unordered, unchangeable, and unindexed.

•	Unorder means that the items in a set do not have a defined order. Duplicates are not allowed in this section

•	Unchangeable means that we cannot change the items after the set has been created. But a set itself may be modified, but the elements contained in the set must be of an immutable type.

•	Unindexed

### Dictionary

Dictionaries are used to store data values in key-value pairs. In python, dictionaries are defined by the following curly braces ‘{ }’ and additions, namely:

•	Each element of the key-value pair is separated by a comma.

•	Key and value are separated by a colon.

•	Key and value can be any variable or object.

A dictionary is a collection that is ordered, changeable, and doesn’t allow duplicates.

The process of converting a Python data type into another type is known as type conversion. We can do the built-in type function, such as: str(), int(), and float()

## Some function that we can use in python :

•	The len function	: used to count the number of variables in the list

•	Append function	  : a function to add a variable to the last list as the last index

•	Del function 	  	: a function that is used to delete a variable in a list by index

•	pop function	  	: function if want to delete and display the last index at the llist

•	Extend	function	: used to another list

•	Remove function	  : used to delete a variable by assigned the variable

•	Index function		: used to find out the index of the assigned variable

•	Count function		: used to count the number of data from the assigned variable

•	Sort function		  : used to sort data

•	Reverse function 	: the opposite of sort so the data will be sorted in reverse
